Description: PolySNPclust calls genotypes from complex Infinium assay signals generated by polyploid species by:
    -Clustering samples for each marker using Gaussian mixture models
    -Removing unimportant cluster types (resulting from outliers) with supervised machine learning,
    -Filtering markers by cluster patterns to only those following biallelic patterns
    -Calling genotypes for the biallelic markers and outputing a genotype matrix compatible with common GWAS/GS methods
