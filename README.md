# PolySNPclust
An R package for calling polyploid SNP chip data.

Author: Matthew McGowan

## Overview
PolySNPclust is an R pipeline for clustering complex signals generated by the Illumina Infinium assay when used in polyploid species. The only input requirement is an R/Theta export generated from a Genome Studio Project. After clustering, users have the option to interactively filter markers and call genotypes for biallelic markers and output them in a simple numerical format for further imputation and use in genome-wide-associaton-study or genomic-selection analysis.

## Requirements
Rstudio 
A spreadsheet editor (Excel, OpenOffice-Calc, Numbers, etc.)

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get PolySNPclust is to install the package using devtools:

# If you don't have devtools already installed:
install.packages("devtools")

# Then load devtools and then install PolySNPclust from Github:
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("mtmcgowan/PolySNPclust")
```
## Usage
The easiest way to learn to use PolySNPclust is to go through the tutorial provided here:

Depending on your population size and marker number, it may be useful to use a high-performance cluster to speed up the clustering step. Here is an example of how this was done for a cluster using the SLURM job scheduler:
